We also received a prompt from one of the Nounders - @seneca. To participate in the contest, your blog post must answer at least one of the prompts.\n\nApart from the eternal glory, you will be able to win a part of the 3.5 ETH prize pool. Our contest is platform agnostic, so you can post your essay anywhere you want - on Paragraph, Mirror, Substack, X, Farcaster, or even ZORA.\n\nEven if you don’t win the main prize, you can win some attention and subscribers because Kiwi and some Nouns members will repost the best submissions.\n\nYou can learn more about the contest here:\nhttps://paragraph.xyz/@kiwi-updates/into-the-nouniverse-writing-contest\n\nPS: Thanks to @ccarella.eth, @nounishprof and @wiz, for helping to set it up, and thanks to all Nouns who supported our prop ⌐◨-◨",
