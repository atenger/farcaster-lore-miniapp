Farcaster wallets are safe and unaffected.\n\nWho was affected?\n\nUsers who gave Amps an allowance to withdraw USDC from their wallet to purchase likes and recasts were affected.\n\nUsers who simply used Amps to receive funds for likes and recasts are unaffected. Users who did not use Amps are unaffected.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe Amps team will publish a detailed report soon.¬† In short, their contract had a vulnerability and the attacker was able to withdraw USDC that the users have given Amps permission to withdraw. \n\nSome users gave Amps the permission to withdraw all USDC from their wallet, and the attacker was able to withdraw all USDC. \n\nAre Farcaster wallets unsafe?\n\nNo, Farcaster wallets remain safe to use. The exploit is entirely within the Amps contract and only affects users who explicitly gave Amps the permission to access their USDC.\n\nWhat should I do to be safe?\n\nNever give permissions to withdraw unlimited funds (as a user) and never ask for these permissions (as a dev). It is safer to ask user to transfer in a fixed amount (e.g. 100 USDC), and top up as needed.",

    "text": "New: Miniapps Homepage\n\nIt's easier than ever to discover new apps or go back to your favorites. \n\nThe homepage has shortcuts to your most recently used apps. We're going to tweak this algo a little bit, and the goal is to always show you apps that you want to get to. \n\nThe homepage now has trending categories, so you can find the best games or social apps. It also has a \"popular\" section that shows you what your friends are using.\n\n\"Popular Among Friends\" was built in a privacy preserving way. It will only show you friends if they have shared the app publicly. Otherwise, it will anonymize the data to \"31 friends have used this\". \n\nThe page still has a few rough edges that we're going to fix over the next week. h/t to @pirosb3 for building this!",

But early on, I met with @christin and @july thanks to a cast about my (our!) favorite bakery.\n\nThey opened my mind to the joy of URL to IRL friendships - a new experience for me personally. This broadened my perspective on community and serendipity here.\n\nWithout that early experience, I would not have had this one. Hanging out with the delightful @aviationdoctor.eth while looking out at the Port of Singapore.\n\nIn a world where social networks divide people, I appreciate Farcaster for being a rare corner that genuinely connects us. I appreciate you all for being here.",

          "text": "Just landed at Singapore‚Äôs Changi Airport for the first time ever. I was supposed to come a while back for a visit with the team here (8th busiest international airport), and a tour of the Port of Singapore (world‚Äôs 2nd largest container port).\n\nThat year was 2020, so plans changed. I got to meet via Zoom, however, with Jaisey Yip, then GM and now VP of the cargo business division at Changi. At the time, she said the primary friction was how stubbornly paper-based the industry remained, largely because people don‚Äôt want to share data.\n\nThe airport is well-positioned to lead technological change. The scale of cargo traffic and advanced manufacturing flowing through and from Singapore is incredible. This is even more remarkable, given the country‚Äôs relatively recent formation.\n\nRight now, I‚Äôm enjoying a morning coffee while feeling like a kid again. I‚Äôm delighting in the virtual sea animals floating above me and live fish swimming in a pond behind me. This is the Dreamscape in Terminal 2, an indoor garden of 20,000 plants and a digital sky that mirrors real-time Changi weather. One of many peaceful exhibits around the airport.\n\nAlso, I am so tired that I didn‚Äôt register what the nice barista said I‚Äôm supposed to do with the cup of cream. I just ate it like a pup cup. üòÜüê∂",

    "text": "** The Farcaster Middle Class ** (my /firstdraft )\n\n'America was built on the backs of the middle class' is a popular quote & every political campaign in the US has to deal with how to build up the 'middle class.'\n\nI think Farcaster has the same issue to consider. Prompted by @miguelgarest.eth cast this morning about the need for a 'full reset of the engagement power for all accounts,' I want to suggest that a lot of the algo issues could be dealt with by 'building up the middle class' of Farcaster. \n\nI think, by most accounts, the 'upper class' is doing well. If you take the top 100 accounts that the algo likes they are getting good engagement, giving off lots of points, & often on the trending feed. Some of those accounts are large and have trouble getting high on the Rewards leaderboard, but in many cases they are making money in other ways on Farcaster to offset that difficulty. I don't want to single people out but in my mind this would be accounts like @toadyhawk.eth @adrienne @nounishprof @tldr -- who I know well enough to single out üòÄ  as examples of top 100 accounts (upper class), for whom it's tough to get high on the leaderboard, but they also have other opportunities on FC. \n\nAlso, doing well are new accounts that get introduced & hyped by OGs and the FC team who are (at least) temporarily put into the upper class. \n\nI think both of the above are good things for Farcaster. \n\nThe middle class is probably 500 accounts that are here daily, most don't have their own projects or they are small. They are supporting other builders, sharing daily life, building community, learning, & being great qDAUs. But, they are fighting to get leaderboard points, they don't give many leaderboard points, and they don't have many other opportunities (or don't create them) and therefore feel a bit passed over because of the amount of time and effort they put in. Their reward, often, is to see a cast with 2 recasts and 8 likes show up on trending while their 30 likes and 10 recasts never touch trending. Their 'bangers' give them 450 leaderboard points while the top 30 are shoveling points in by the thousands with a pickleball photo. Again, giving a few examples of the great middle class that fit this description that I know well enough to name: @hankmoody @pichi @burrrrrberry & a one off example quoted below of @chriscocreated releasing an app that never hit the trending (look at the numbers, just like miguel's quoted cast I think he said never hit the trending)\n\nI like @miguelgarest.eth suggestion of a reset of power. I want to suggest that whatever could be done to the algo to identify the middle class and build them up would serve Farcaster as well as it has America when it has focused on the middle class. \n\nHow to do that is beyond my pay grade. Can devs do something??? ü§£ \n\nI have more thoughts on who they are, how to identify them, & how to reward them. So, hit me up if you are in a position to do something, and maybe I need to expand this into a full @paragraph article\n\nThank you for coming to my political rally for the Farcaster Middle Class. \n\nhttps://farcaster.xyz/miguelgarest.eth/0x7236ecee",

    "text": "The Algo‚Äôs Just Not That Into You\n\nSomething weird is happening on Farcaster, and it‚Äôs time we talk about it openly. This isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúhome feed doing home feed things.‚Äù It‚Äôs much deeper and more concerning. \n\nSome casts are skyrocketing with 10k+ views from accounts that have 1k followers. Meanwhile, longtime casters with 100k+ followers are seeing reach crater by 50%. The math doesn‚Äôt add up‚Ä¶unless something‚Äôs being boosted.\n\nWe‚Äôre watching artificial amplification play out in real time and this experiment needs to end now before more trust is lost. \n\nThe algorithm cares more about engagement quality than raw follower numbers. There are several Dune queries who show the most popular casters by the numbers, but they do NOT align with the Farcaster Leaderboard. We know that not everyone‚Äôs engagement is weighted equally, and most of us have come to begrudgingly accept this fact. \n\nThe home and trending feed have always favored certain accounts, and as little as two engagements with those accounts can amplify a cast to trending.  We see it and have come to terms with it. \n\nBut recently, we‚Äôve seen a new trend emerge: artificial algorithmic boosting‚Ä¶to levels never before seen on Farcaster‚Ä¶and we need to stop dancing around the subject and talk about it. \n\nA user with 1,000 followers might have a highly active niche audience, while someone with 250,000 might have a large but disengaged base‚Ä¶but we have Dune queries to show us how ‚Äúactive‚Äù each account‚Äôs followers have been over the last 7 and 30 days. \n\nVery large accounts (6-figure followings) tend to have about 50% of their followers be considered ‚Äúactive‚Äù under this metric (active=have casted, liked, or recasted).\n\nNewer accounts skew higher because many are only a few weeks old, so most of their followers are obviously active. \n\nIf the algorithm is boosting based on more active followers, it could explain the great discrepancies we are seeing in reach, so we need to look deeper. \n\nA new tool has emerged that lets us look into the number of unique accounts that interacted with a user's content in the last 30 days, and the data is very telling. This data counts everyone on the protocol, not just those with good spam labels. \n\nIf you think your engagement has gone down a lot over the past few weeks, you aren‚Äôt imagining it. Usually, if 2-3% of your followers interact with your casts, you are doing great.  But what if most of the people who follow you never even see your casts in the latest version of the algorithm? Spoiler alert: they don‚Äôt. \n\nLet‚Äôs compare some of the biggest, most established accounts on the network to newer accounts who I believe are being artificially amplified. \n\nThese accounts all have well over 100,000 followers each (even more on the protocol!), cast daily, and consistently engage back with the network. Their content and casting patterns have not changed noticeably over the last 30 days. \n\nThe number of unique accounts they have reached in the last 30 days and how much their engagement is down is as follows:\n\n15,400 (down 67%)\n7,500 (down 49%)\n1,500 (down 29%)\n2,700 (down 36%)\n6,500 (down 55%)\n4,200 (down 54%)\n\nNow let‚Äôs compare this to one of the new accounts that I believe are being purposely placed into many users‚Äô home feeds (note that these accounts have 1,000-3,000 followers). \n\n10,500\n\nThe number of views on many of their casts are also between 10,000 and 18,000 views. Remember, the data above shows interactions, but even more people have seen these casts!\n\nA user with 1,000 followers getting seen by 10,000+ people requires external amplification.\n\nThat reach doesn‚Äôt emerge organically. The algorithm chose to show them beyond their organic social graph. \n\nObserving a few examples of weird reach/follower ratios doesn‚Äôt necessarily prove systemic bias.  Visibility is complex and can swing based on timing, interaction graphs, and reposts by top casters, but the math doesn‚Äôt add up without boosting.\n\nThe people getting boosted didn‚Äôt necessarily ask to be. Now they‚Äôre targets of backlash; they are victims as well. \n\nMeanwhile, those who have not had this type of algorithmic boost feel invisible and demoralized, even if they‚Äôve consistently added value to the community.\n\nIt‚Äôs creating a toxic imbalance that erodes trust across the board. We can politely say ‚Äúvibes are off‚Äù and tell people to just mute what they don‚Äôt want to see, but that‚Äôs not going to solve the issue at hand. This is deeper than engagement FOMO.\nWe are watching something we‚Äôve invested time into start to resemble the very platforms we came here to escape.\n\nThe algorithm may be silent, but its choices are loud. If it is hand picking winners, the rest of us should stop pretending we‚Äôre playing the same game. Invest your time here accordingly.",
