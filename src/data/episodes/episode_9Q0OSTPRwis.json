I worry about this the most.\n\nIrony 1: The art community is the most vibrant community any social community can have. We literally have generational talent hanging out amongst us & most of us are unaware.\n\nIrony 2: Artists who are here are the most tech forward of the normie bunch we'd wanna onboard.

The role combined 3 of my biggest passions: Photography, traveling & working the cc points system. \n\nI wasn‚Äôt paid to travel, but b/c I was earning the majority of my flights, hotels, and transpo via reward points, they hired me to document my journeys around the world. \n\nI‚Äôve been to 49 countries, gravitating to outdoor adventures & nature. I‚Äôm a hiker, biker, skier, climber, and surfer.\n\n/adventure is a home for adrenaline junkies & nature lovers.\n\nI‚Äôve been bad about promoting it, but that ends today.\n\nI‚Äôll be sharing pics + stories of places I‚Äôve been fortunate to visit. Hopefully others will post theirs too so I can add some new spots to my bucket list. \n\nWill also mix in travel tips + gear + cc hacks + other fun stuff.\n\nI‚Äôll kick it off tomorrow, but for now, enjoy this pic of the most picturesque football pitch on the planet located in the Lofoten Islands. If you squint really hard maybe you can see us ;)",
