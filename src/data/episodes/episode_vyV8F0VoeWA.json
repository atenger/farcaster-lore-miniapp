I plan to delete this cast once the issue (raised by others too) gets acknowledged in some way.\n\nI often see “User A” in my Home feed. I don’t follow them. Content isn’t spammy or offensive - just not my preference. I figured not interacting would signal disinterest to the algorithm, but \"User A\" shows up a lot.\n\nThe other day, their cast was the first one in my Home feed. I finally decided to tap “Show fewer like this” and refreshed the feed.\n\nA different cast from this user showed up as the first one in my Home feed, again. I tapped \"Shower fewer like this\" again. Refreshed again.\n\nYet another cast from the same user was the first in my Home feed (third time in a row!). This time I gave up, accepted the algorithm's sense of humor, and decided to keep scrolling.\n\nBut this third cast was a very short video. The audio glitched and kept playing even as I scrolled. I switched to the Following tab, Trending tab, navigated to channels. The audio kept playing on a loop (agh).\n\nSo I ended up force-quitting the app. I still see casts from this user. I'm aware the other tool available is mute, but haven't used it yet.\n\nMuting feels too blunt. I don’t want to avoid DCs from this individual. I just want my Home feed to closer resemble my preferences.\n\nTwo things would be very appreciated:\n\n1) Clarification on how the current controls work (most immediate need)\n\n2) A middle ground between \"mute\" and \"show more of this\" (not urgent for my experience but a nice to have)\n\nThis is not a judgment on any content here. I know my content is not everyone's cup of tea. I really wouldn’t want anyone stuck seeing it at the top of their feed after expressing repeatedly they don't want it.\n\nI appreciate anyone reading this. Long live Farcaster.\n\nOther casts noting similar issue:\n- https://farcaster.xyz/horsefax.eth/0xa9b5250d\n- https://farcaster.xyz/0x-omen.eth/0xbd80c0dd\n- https://farcaster.xyz/kylepatrick.eth/0x52555611\n- https://farcaster.xyz/pichi/0x10a073f1",

I used neon with vercel since easy integration\n5. deploy to vercel\n6. set up farcaster specific features like a manifest and embed\n7. once deployed, use ngrok to test mini app locally so not testing new features live with users",
