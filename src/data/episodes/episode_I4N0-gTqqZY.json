    "text": "Reexploring Warpcast the last 48 hours, here’s my first thoughts: \n\n∙ “oh wow, app store? cool. Reminds me of telegram’s and also respect the team for shipping new features”\n∙  “oh I can’t talk in channels anymore? Wait, I can, just not all” \n∙ “what channels should I join?” \n\nI found myself looking at profiles of people whose taste I trust and seeing where they engage \n\nSo far, big shout out to @ted who recommended a few channels and connected me to some people already. As a user, I find stickiness on social apps really comes down to \n1. Content discovery \n2. two-way communication early on \n\nThings I’m still wondering: \n∙ best apps and frames? \n\nFor example I learned about @askgina.eth from @ericjuta and @sidshekhar and @pentacle.eth ‘s web3 resource. @greenfarmer showed me Slate. @linda showed me @bountycaster, @garrett with dune dashies for fc data \n\nA lot of what I found was through the help of people like Ted sharing, native discoverability could be an aha moment",

Introducing Moxie Smart Allowances!\n \nEvery Farcaster user now gets a daily smart allowance based on their prior week’s engagement. Users with more engagement diversity & quality get higher allowances. Allowances reset at 11am Monday. The system rewards quality, limits spammers & farmers\n\nWant higher allowances? Spread your Moxie across more users who appreciate your engagement!  \n\n2. Moxie Heroes are here! \n\nThis week 30 Moxie Heroes get a 2x boost to their FarScore -- so they give out twice the MOXIE with every engagement \n\nHeroes' superpowers last the full week \n\nA new set of heroes is launched each week based on prior week quality of engagement \n\nHeroes will be rotated so no one is a hero in consecutive weeks \n\nAdditional powers will be revealed incoming weeks",
