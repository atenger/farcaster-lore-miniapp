Rewards come directly from app revenue (because it‚Äôs BETR to win together.) You can Spin-to-Claim and compound your rewards once per day for a chance to win a Staking Stackpot prize as well. People seem to like all this, because 31B tokens have been staked already representing 55% of circulating supply üí™ \n\n‚ú®We hired @burr.eth a couple months back as our CFO (Chief Fun Officer) and she does an awesome job running community initiatives like regular freeroll poker games, art contests and more. \n\n‚ú® Our favorite thing about building on @base.base.eth and Farcaster is the composability of the tech + the collaborative nature of the builders here, so we love jamming with other projects and communities to cross-pollinate and grow the pie. \n\n‚ú®Our North Star is to help find novel ways for creators tonget paid for their creativity while building the strongest values-aligned token community on Base. \n\nStill day one!",

    "text": "Here's a deep dive into what caused this very painful outage.  Tap into the thread for details. \n\nWhen you link a token to a cast like $DEGEN, it creates an embed. Our server hydrates this embed with data like the image, token creator and stores it in our database so we can show it to you quickly. \n\nWhen we launched token news, we added a lot of info to the token object like the casts that were included in the news. We didn't realize that our hydrator was including all the news and news casts into this object every time we created a token link. \n\nWe recently ended up in a recursive state because some of the casts in the token news had token links themselves. Now a cast with token link would trigger our server to include the news object, which contained casts, some of which contained the same token link and so on..... \n\nThese casts would quickly balloon in size to 5 to 10 MB each. Our feed generator tries to fetch all the casts you want to read, order them and then compress them and put them into redis. This compression made the CPU on the feed workers stall. \n\nIt got very bad very fast where as soon as a worker would come up, it would start picking jobs off the queue and stall immediately. We couldn't even SSH into the box to figure out what was going on. \n\nThe way we ended up handling it is shutting off various parts of the feed generation until we could figure out a few problematic lines of code. We also scaled back the processor and forced it to run very slowly so we could get into the boxes and profile things, and both of these threads eventually led to us finding the culprits and fixing them.",

          "text": "onchain activism is here\n\nyesterday we saw something unprecedented: rainbow issued an open letter to $clanker holders offering to acquire the company in a structured all-token deal \n\nthis wasn‚Äôt a casual blog post, it was a third attempt after private talks failed. when clanker management declined, rainbow went public‚Äîeffectively issuing a hostile takeover bid‚Äîasking token holders themselves to pressure management into accepting\n\nfor months, clanker‚Äôs community has voiced frustration at the lack of value accrual to the token. a vacuum that created this opening, where rainbow then stepped in with a clear message: if management won‚Äôt drive token value, we will\n\nthis is the first public attempt at activist tokenholder pressure‚Äîand it won‚Äôt be the last. and while i stand wholeheartedly at clankers side here & think the move was unnecessarily aggressive, i understand it, and it begs the questions: what if clanker was a dao? what if the token was deeply tied to protocol revenues already? and what if 51% of the holderbase agreed to the terms? \n\nfurther, does it even matter? why does rainbow need permission to fork & vampire clanker? what keeps people coming back to clanker in the first place? and do we really want to give token holders rights?\n\nthis is so-called \"internet capital markets,\" and these are things i've been thinking about for awhile\n\nit's also worth noting that we are deep in the process of establishing a consortium that, among other things, will work for & defend the ecosystem against these very things \n\nanyway, i looked back at some older posts & pulled some things that may be useful\n\n1. on tokenholders as owners, the rise of tokenholder rights & open letters\n\nhttps://x.com/0xbasil/status/1883225800536711651?s=46\n\ni‚Äôve written before that most crypto founders are not ready for the responsibility that comes with revenue-backed tokens:\n\n‚Äúfounders must be prepared to treat their token holders like shareholders‚Äîlike owners, like their bosses. if they don‚Äôt like your direction, they will team up and attempt to take you down. activist funds will come in, write a hit piece, kill your token price, buy up half your float, or look to replace you via a public campaign.‚Äù\n\nthis isn‚Äôt hypothetical anymore. rainbow just showed us what that playbook looks like. if you give tokenholder rights, you must be prepared for tokenholders to act like owners.\n\n2. on fleeting ideas, industry maturity & consolidation \n\nhttps://farcaster.xyz/itsbasil/0x3ab3562d\n\nthis also fits into a larger arc. i‚Äôve said before that since the experimental defi summer stage, crypto has been entering maturity:\n\n‚Äúas the market is captured, maturity is realized, fees are reduced.... innovation has slowed, competition has increased, and we‚Äôre moving toward an era of consolidation. growth will be m&a-driven. not all of us can win; there will be winners and losers. the only way to protect your token is to front-run consolidation with a locked flywheel at the network level.‚Äù\n\nrainbow‚Äôs move is a textbook consolidation play. they‚Äôre trying to fold a stagnant token into their own system to capture liquidity, users, and narrative momentum. it won‚Äôt stop here‚Äîothers will follow\n\nunder the guise of \"an everything app,\" your partner becomes your enemy... the top of the funnel is a now a battleground \n\n3. on your token as the product & your product as the token \n\nhttps://farcaster.xyz/itsbasil/0x12d0c60c\n\nthis also validates another thesis: your token & your product are inseparable. the best marketing & business development departments are big market caps \n\n‚Äúnobody‚Äôs partnering with clanker if the token is sitting at $230k. traders and investors won‚Äôt engage with your product if the token is a ghost town. your product and token are deeply intertwined‚Äîit‚Äôs all connected.‚Äù\n\nrainbow understands this. by making a direct offer to tokenholders, they‚Äôre acknowledging that control of the token = control of the product. though, clearly, those rights aren't there yet\n\n4. control your fate\n\n>on owning your own token & controlling your fate\n\nhttps://farcaster.xyz/itsbasil/0x755dc9d6\n\nfinally, this moment underscores the importance of founders owning their token & controlling their fate:\n\n‚Äúsub-$10m cap with minimal founder ownership is a strategic handcuff. you can‚Äôt raise, can‚Äôt defend, can‚Äôt negotiate. control enough supply to stay flexible‚Äîthen lock it long enough to prove you‚Äôre serious.‚Äù\n\nwithout meaningful ownership & strategic ammo, you‚Äôre vulnerable to exactly this kind of pressure\n\nthe takeaway\n\nafaik, rainbow‚Äôs open letter is the first true act of onchain activism. it sets a precedent: if founders don‚Äôt deliver value, others will come knocking‚Äîsometimes politely, but evidently, increasingly not\n\nthis is why loyalty, alignment, and clear value accrual for holders matter more than ever. tokenholders aren‚Äôt just your community. they are your shareholders, your activists, your marketeers, your potential acquirers\n\nif you don‚Äôt treat them like owners, someone else will\n\ndisclaimer: this is not in any way, shape or form a knock on clanker. posting only for posterity & learnings. i stand fully with clanker & i'm excited about working with them to build the future of our ecosystem",

    "text": "Last night‚Äôs class was primarily focused on tokenomics with the students presenting a token concept in class. Plus they had an in class assignment to learn to send & swap. It‚Äôs always interesting to see what happens when you teach people how to use a wallet. \n\nI funded all their wallets on Farcaster and they needed to send a small amount to their @baseapp.base.eth  & @rainbow wallets. That part was pretty easy. Finding the wallet address is sometimes the hardest part. They also needed to submit the basescan link for each part of the assignment (easiest to find is on Farcaster btw ‚Äî activity clearly labeled and link pops up). \n\nThen came swaps and this first one was easy. The Farcaster wallet is so intuitive. They had to swap from base eth to Solana on FC. Easy peazy. Which is so crazy! \n\nThey also needed to swap using @matchaxyz and @uniswap which led to learning about slippage! And @walletconnect. They needed to swap a small amount of eth for any token on Base ‚Äî most chose $xtra (I told them I‚Äôd send extra $xtra) The sudden activity on $xtra led to some txs that couldn‚Äôt process. \n\nFor Matcha, they did ok. If it wouldn‚Äôt process, it was usually because they were on the wrong chain. For Uniswap, some couldn‚Äôt get it to process. Again mostly due to ‚Äúwrong chain‚Äù issues. But I was surprised how this interface was more challenging. \n\nThis is the first time I‚Äôve had students use so many different wallets and products. It‚Äôs been interesting to see what they find easy and what is more challenging.\n\nI do truly believe now that the Farcaster wallet is definitely the easiest for newbies.  cc: @dwr @slokh \n\nPlus we burned half a billion $xtra using /glanker to see the impact on the chart. So if you saw a bunch of activity last night, that was why.",
