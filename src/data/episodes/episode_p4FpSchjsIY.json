    "text": "Will answer your specific questions first, then share some more on safety. These are gonna be long so will reply separately for each.\n\nWALLET ACCESS\n\n> If we can grant wallet access to mini apps easily in Farcaster, why can‚Äôt we revoke them just as easily?\n\n\"Wallet access\" is an overloaded term. If you're using a mini app, what can it actually do with your wallet? \n\n1. Read token balances. \nFarcaster is a public social network and your token balances are all public onchain. So really anyone has this capability. But when you use a mini app it does know about your wallet address and the tokens in it, as well as your Farcaster identity.\n\n2. Make requests to do things. \nMini apps can ask your wallet to send a transaction or sign a message, but you the human user must always approve or reject them. That doesn't mean they can't try to trick you! But you are always in the loop.\n\nSo how can you tell if a request is legit?\n\nThe first screenshot here is Tortoise by @mattlee requesting a transaction to mint a song. When a mini app requests a transaction we scan it with blockaid.io and show you what it will do. In this case I'm sending $4.24 of ETH and getting back an NFT. We also show the domain (tortoise dot studio) and the mini app context (you can see this is Tortoise and it was created by Matt)\n\nYou can also tap into \"Advanced\" and see more technical information about exactly what it's doing. (See the second screenshot). This is very useful if you're suspicious of a particular request but not that readable to a normal human.\n\nIf the request is flagged as malicious we block it. If it's flagged as suspicious we show a warning. We do our best here, but transaction scanning is never perfect: there are always both false positives and false negatives. (In fact, I think we get much more grief from developers for false positives than anything else).\n\n3. Request token approvals. \nThis is really a special case of #2 but since it's so common and can be more dangerous it deserves its own category. One kind of request a mini app can make is asking you to give it an \"approval\" to spend some amount of a token. This can be a limited or unlimited amount. This pattern is deeply baked into crypto and very much an original sin of crypto UX. \n\nThe third screenshot here is Crowdfund asking me to approve spending 5 USDC as a donation. If you see an app ask for an unlimited approval here, that's usually a red flag. \n\nOf all the things a mini app can do, you should be most careful about approving requests for token approvals. It's the only thing that allows an app to \"do something\" with the money in your wallet when you're not physically there.\n\nBut there are many legitimate use cases for approvals. For example, approvals are what enable Tipn and Noice to send tips on your behalf.\n\nThere's nothing to \"disconnect\" or \"revoke\" for 1 and 2. For 3, you can check and revoke approvals with other mini apps (will share one below).\n\nViewing/revoking approvals is something we can and should build in to the app/wallet and I think we will soon.",

If we can grant wallet access to mini apps easily in Farcaster, why can‚Äôt we revoke them just as easily?\n\n2. Why isn‚Äôt there some kind of ‚Äúverified‚Äù badge yet in the mini app ecosystem to mark developers who‚Äôve gone through a vetting process?\n\nCurrently, to my beginner eyes, all apps look equal. I‚Äôm personally going to exercise a lot more caution going forward. But, given the simultaneous push for mini apps and new users, additional security features feel critical for growth in both.\n\nI‚Äôm feeling a little spooked honestly after using a mini app that felt like it was for a good cause. I‚Äôm surprised I missed a lot of information shared in the thread below, despite being on Farcaster every day for a few months now. More context:",

    "text": "I hate to say it but the Solana trenches are rinsed. \n\nThe $pop wallet that FSH'd ~$22k was slowly selling over the past 24 hours after receiving multitudinous inbound transfers of the token from a number of accounts, all in denominations equivalent to roughly $950. \n\nThis is a typical strategy to obfuscate the source of funds (Slerf tools has easy to use and cheap functions for this). \n\nThe wallet never made a purchase of the actual token, it only received the tokens for free. \n\nIt got impatient and dumped everything it held. Over the course it was more than 35% of the total supply of the token.",
