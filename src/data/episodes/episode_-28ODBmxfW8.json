See if they would be willing to share it.\n\nBut stepping back, here's the best way to offer feedback directly (preferred!):\n\n1. Public feedback — expect a potential reply. If it's small, will give you a short answer. If it's longer / larger, there's going to be a lot more weight into how it's communicated and how accurate it is (i.e. are you up to date on everything that's going on).\n\n2. Private feedback — send me a DC. I respond to most of them. Avoid the wall of text cold message as it's hard to parse. Also usually good if we have some public back and forth history first",
