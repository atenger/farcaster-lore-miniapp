May take some time for people to start responding, but certainly the next time they open the app up they will have a full notifications feed and hopefully some thoughtful content.\n\nIf \"casts with no chance of reply\" is how you're viewing this, i.e. it's a negative, just don't follow an account or if you're seeing recasts, mute them.\n\nThe pragmatic view: still a higher chance that an account replies to you on Farcaster than on Twitter.

But while it is a useful tool for making connections, keeping up with headlines, and picking up clues for further inquiry, there is no substitute for lifelong study built on a foundation of reading books, long-form essays, and reports.\n\nI encourage everyone to set a goal for book reading in a given year. It does not need to that ambitious, but it helps to set a target. For a period of roughly a decade I read around 100 books per year. Due to life circumstances I’ve scaled this down to around 40. But even 10 or 20 would make a difference.\n\nBooks are not just a means to obtain information but also have salutary neurological effects. They teach you how to remain focused and structure abstract information. The trick is that you should read what you find most interesting, and not what others necessarily tell you to read.\n\nThe quote below is when I knew SBF would be a fraud:",

We took inspiration from it while our site was still under construction.\n\n2nd - We clearly instructed users not to use the website, and all paying users are aware of what's currently available on the platform.\n\n3rd - The brand logos were placeholders used during development and were never meant to imply any false affiliations. We have removed them to avoid any further misunderstandings. We want to emphasize that we are not sponsored in any way with the branded affiliations. \n\nI respect you as a fellow Farcaster and a good builder, and I want to apologize again for the disappointment and any actions that may have caused it.\n\nIf we confused other users with the website, particularly with the sponsorship banner, @cauliflower and I would like to apologize sincerely.",
